The original source of this code is found in the AP-Hunt FicsitRemoteMonitoring Companion
project. Which had the code within a lower directory. I chose to pull it out and include it
as a `pkg` here to allow for better use of the library in external projects. Since
`go mod` cannot include from a sub directory.
